        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>When you’re designing a website, it’s best practice to think about who’s going to use it. This sometimes involves crafting fictional personas that represent your ideal user, and building according to their needs.

            According to Elsa Vane, the Accessibility Specialist at Pluralsight, people are all too often thinking of a person without a disability, and this influences their design decisions.
            
            “It’s only further along in the process that someone says ‘Hey, did we think about accessibility?’ And someone answers ‘Oh, we forgot about it, let’s talk about it now.’” 
            
            By thinking about accessibility at the earliest stages, this makes it easier to include it in the final design, rather than working against the grain halfway through the process.</p>
